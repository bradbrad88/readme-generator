## Usage

After installation, simply run the command

```

in the terminal. A series of questions will prompt you for input to assist in creating the README.md file.

Options include the -y flag. Similar to

It will reduce the number of questions prompted and attempt to gather data automatically through the package.json file, git config variables and directory structure.
