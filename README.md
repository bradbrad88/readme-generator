## Installation

To install, run the following command:

```properties
npm i -g https://github.com/bradbrad88/readme-generator
```

## Usage

After installation, simply run the command

```properties
readme
```

in the terminal. A series of questions will prompt you for input to assist in creating the README.md file.

Options include the -y flag. Similar to

```properties
npm init -y

It will reduce the number of questions prompted and attempt to gather data automatically through the package.json file, git config variables and directory structure.
